# Kahi impactu postcalculations
This plugin helps to calculate netwoks, top words and some other stuff from the impactu output.

# Description
Supports the calculation of the following metrics:
- Co-authorship network 
  - affiliations
  - authors 
- Top words for 
  - affiliations 
  - authors

# Installation

## Dependencies
This package requires MongoDB to be installed and running and kahi already executed.

## Package
To install the package, run the following command:
`pip install kahi_impactu_postcalculations
`


# Usage

example for workflow:

```
config:
  database_url: localhost:27017
  database_name: kahi
  log_database: kahi
  log_collection: log
workflow:
  impactu_postcalculations:
    database_url: localhost:27017
    database_name: kahi_calculations
    openalex_database_url: localhost:27017
    openalex_database_name: openalexco
    inference_endpoint: http://localhost:8082/invocations
    topics_enabled: true
    topic_jobs: 4
    topic_batch_size: 1
    topic_request_timeout: 300
    topic_request_retries: 3
    denormalization_enabled: true
    networks_enabled: true
    top_words_strategy: legacy
    top_words_batch_size: 500
    top_words_backend: threading
    top_words_jobs: 4
    force_recalculate: false
    backend: multiprocessing
    n_jobs: 6
    verbose: 5
    author_count: 6 #use this with warning, maybe the network is too big and it can not be saved in MongoDB
```

Notes:
- Denormalization runs with collection-level parallelization enabled by default.
- The internal denormalization parallel setup is fixed to `parallel_collections = true`.
- The internal denormalization parallel setup is fixed to `collection_jobs = 3`.
- These two values are defined in code and are not configurable from the workflow YAML.
- Topic inference sends `topic_batch_size` works per request and writes each
  completed batch with a single unordered bulk operation.
- Set `denormalization_enabled: false` only when denormalization already
  completed and the plugin is being resumed at topic inference.
- Set `force_recalculate` to `true` when the calculations database contains
  results from an older ETL and networks/top words must be refreshed.
- Set `networks_enabled` to `false` to skip affiliation and person
  co-authorship networks without disabling the remaining post-calculations.
- Set `topics_enabled` to `false` to skip topic inference when all pending
  works were already processed and the plugin is being resumed.
- `top_words_backend` and `top_words_jobs` control only the top-words phase.
  Use `threading` with a small worker count to avoid exhausting MongoDB
  connections while the general plugin backend remains unchanged.
- Set `top_words_strategy: works_scan` to compute person and affiliation
  top words by scanning `works` once. The output schema is unchanged, but
  titles are processed once per work instead of once per person/affiliation.
- Type-mapping warnings are emitted only with `verbose: 4` or higher. Type
  mappings are compiled once per source and reused by all workers.
